This is the tool that creates the background for the WebSVN and the Website,
it is also the tool that creates the images for afgui. It is written in C
and uses libgd. It is a very simple algorithm but effective in what it does.
It can be expanded on, by adding new functions to manipulate the data or by
taking out some lines of the code. 

The program takes a list of PNG graphic's (four files specificly) stored in 
text format. You can most easily create this list by using a shell, I use
bash. For creating a list I use

$ ls | grep '.png' > list.txt

but you could also just edit a text file and put the path names for each
file one per line.
