KMasterPiece

	licence GPL

This is not a port of Masterpiece but a recode of the game using Qt4.
The program runs on a variety of platforms supported by  Qt4.
It is a simple game same game I always make when Im learning something new.
You have three blocks, you can switch them up and down. You place the blocks
and when three line up of the same color, going up down or diagonal it will 
dissappear. The graphics are just simple 'dummy' graphics and hopefully will
be replaaced. 

Features:

		* Options window:
			- ability to change games movement speed
		* High Scores:
			- high scores are stored in a text file

Todo for future versions:

		Networking support for multiplayer
		Better graphics!! (hopefully)
		

How to build:

	well install the qt4 development librarys on kubuntu its

	sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev

	go to the console type these commands:


	svn co svn://lostsidedead.com/kmasterpiece
	cd kmasterpiece
	qmake -project
	qmake
	make

then once its built run the application with the following:

	./kmasterpiece

if the graphics data is in a different folder use the following arguments

	./kmasterpiece --path /path/to/data
